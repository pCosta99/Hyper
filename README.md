The best game you'll ever see, for iOS and Android apps.

## What's our objective?
We intend to learn how to develop a mobile app from scratch. We are also interested in dealing with AI so we chose to do a game!

## What's our stack?
To accomplish our goals we are going to use the following technologies:
  * Mobile frontend - [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/)
  * Backend - [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) with [Phoenix](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/overview.html)
  * AI - Python

## Why each of the above?

### Flutter
  * None of us are proficient in frontend technologies so we just chose what seemed best between [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) and [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/).

### Elixir with Phoenix
  * [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) capitalizes on the ErlangVM which provides it with handy approaches to real-time applications and fault tolerance, being the former the most desired for a game.
  * [Phoenix](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/overview.html) includes out-of-the-box functionality to use [PubSub](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_pubsub/Phoenix.PubSub.html) and [Channels](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/channels.html) to create real time applications with ez.

### Python
  * No clue about this one, but Python seems to be the bomb.
